<p class="content">The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle 
    of the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen.It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted 
    and brewed in a similar way to how it is prepared now. Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay awake for their religious rituals.
    Accounts differ on the origin of the coffee plant prior to its appearance in Yemen. From Ethiopia, coffee could have been introduced to Yemen via trade across the Red Sea.
    By the 16th century, coffee had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia, Turkey, and northern Africa. The first coffee seeds were smuggled out of the Middle East by 
    Sufi Baba Budan from Yemen to the Indian subcontinent during the time. Before then, all exported coffee was boiled or otherwise sterilised. Portraits of Baba Budan depict
    him as having smuggled seven coffee seeds by strapping them to his chest. The first plants grown from these smuggled seeds were planted in Mysore.

    Coffee had spread to Italy by 1600, and then to the rest of Europe, Indonesia, and the Americas.
    Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit,
    the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: 
    roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.</p>
